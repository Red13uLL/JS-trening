    <h3>
        The function definition can use any parameter name it likes.<br> They decided to use arr because this describes the parameter type but they could equally validly have called it ‘astronaut’ or ‘pig’ or<br> anything else that comes to mind.<br>        (Ideally something that makes sense though) As for let min = infinity, that’s just the developer’s way of saying,<br> I’m about to try to find the min value of this array. Assume that the min value is infinity so that any value<br> smaller than
        that will count as the new ‘min’<br> Then they loop through the array to find a number smaller. Let’s say they find 50 first, <br>so then min becomes 50 (because that is the smallest one they found so far)<br> Then they loop again and maybe they
        find 0.5 next, so then that becomes the new min.<br> Then later they find 5, 3, 20, 8 and none of those are smaller than 0.5 so they don’t become the min.<br><br><br> etc. hope this helps<br><br> edit: and to be clear, the points array is definitely
        being passed into the function in this line<br> document.getElementById(“demo”).innerHTML = myArrayMax(points);<br>
